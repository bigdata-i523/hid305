It begins by clarifying current notions of competitive advantage in strategic literature and highlights the current organizational challenges in taking advantage of the big data trend, as well as the possible advantages and opportunities. Finally, a case study discussion provides insights from practice and highlights points of attention, for those pursuing big data-driven competitive advantage.},

In this regard, it is regarded as a legal entity so that its activities are not overshadowed by other urban activities. In this paper, a linear mathematical programming model has been designed for integrated SWM. Using Lingo software and required data from Tehran, the proposed model has been applied for Tehran SWM system as a case study.},
