Solid Waste Management (SWM) is a set of consistent and systematic regulations related to control generation, storage, collection, transportation, processing and land filling of wastes according to the best public health principles, economy, preservation of resources, aesthetics, other environmental requirements and what the public attends to ~\cite{akbarpour2016}

Managing solid waste is one of an essential services which often fails due to
rapid urbanization along with changes in the waste quantity and composition.
Quantity and composition vary from country to country making them difficult to
adopt for waste management system which may be successful at other places.
Quantity and composition of solid waste vary from place to place ~\cite{chandrappa2012}
