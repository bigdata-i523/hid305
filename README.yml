        As waste management becomes a greater concern for cities and municipalities
        around the world, big data analysis has the potential to not only help assess
        the current waste management strategies, but also provide information that
        can be used to optimize the systems used in various institutions, local government,
        companies, etc.

       In recent history, the explosion of smart devices, social media
       platforms and the Internet of Things has resulted in major
       replication of data.  This data is transferred at high speeds,
       in large volumes and in a variety of different platforms. Data
       is one of the biggest assets of companies and with the
       exponential growth of data comes an increasing problem:
       Security and Privacy. Security and privacy have become a major
       initiative for every organization that has or utilizes
       databases.  These organizations need to protect their brands,
       avoid penalties, and, in worst case scenarios, avoid
       circumstances in which they may either lose a significant
       amount of business or their business as a whole. The computer
       science industry, alongside of these organizations, need to
       continue to develop ways to protect, utilize, and gain
       real-time insight from the data that each organization
       has. This paper is going to highlight security and privacy in
       Big Data, alongside of specific issues and challenges related
       to security.
